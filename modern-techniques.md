# Use modern techniques, but still provide fallbacks for legacy browsers

We recognise that frontend technologies are continually evolving and want to take advantage fo these developments to continually improve our frontend builds. However, this should not be done at the expense of users on older browsers, when using new techniques we should always include fallbacks.

Websites donâ€™t have to look identical in modern and legacy browsers, but they should be usable in both.
