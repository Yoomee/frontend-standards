# Accessibility

We consider ensuring accessibility to be an important part of website development that should be considered at all stages of the process.

At the design phase we use a colour contrast checker plugin for Sketch to check as early as possible that we're not creating inaccessible designs.

During the website build phase we make sure to build in accessibility features such as keyboard accessibility and aria tags as we go along.

We use the WAVE toolbar, http://wave.webaim.org/extension/, to check our pages once they are built, this tool checks for a range of accessibility issues including html structure, aria tags, image alt text and colour contrast.

We also use the A11Y Project checklist, http://a11yproject.com/checklist.html, to make sure we've covered all relevant areas.
