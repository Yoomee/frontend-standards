# Mobile first

We take a mobile first approach, utilising responsive web design, to ensure that websites we build will work well on a wide range of different devices and screen sizes.

Key aspects of our approach include:

* designing the user interface to work well at different screen sizes, considering key elements such as the navigation is especially important here
* content prioritisation
* optimising Javascript and CSS performance
* responsive images
* testing on a range of mobile devices
